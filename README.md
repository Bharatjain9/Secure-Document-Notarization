# Secure Document Notarization

## 📌 Project Title
**Secure Document Notarization using Solidity**

## 📖 Project Description
This project enables secure, tamper-proof, and verifiable document notarization on the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of uploading the full document, only a cryptographic hash of the document is stored, ensuring privacy and security while proving the document’s existence at a specific point in time.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To provide a decentralized, transparent, and trustless solution for document verification, eliminating the need for traditional notary services. It empowers users to prove document authenticity without revealing its contents.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🔒 **Document Hash Storage**: Stores document hashes immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.
- 🕒 **Timestamped Notarization**: Records the exact time when the document was notarized.
- 👤 **Ownership Tracking**: Links each notarized document to the user’s Ethereum address.
- 🔍 **Document Verification**: Allows public verification of the document’s authenticity and timestamp.
- 🛑 **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents the same document from being notarized more than once.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- 📂 **Document Metadata Support**: Store additional info like title, description, or category.
- 🔄 **Ownership Transfer**: Allow document ownership to be transferred between users.
- 🧾 **Revocation Mechanism**: Ability to mark documents as revoked or invalid.
- 🌐 **Web3 Integration**: Build a front-end DApp for user-friendly notarization and verification.
- ✅ **Off-chain Proof Generator**: Tool to create and verify document hashes off-chain with user interface.
